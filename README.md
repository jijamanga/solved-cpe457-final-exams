You have been given a non-malicious crackme.  To learn the correct password, you must analyze the binary, but this time it will not be so easy.  If you have the correct password, executing the executable should tell you as much, otherwise it will print nothing.

You have been assigned a “group id” to use which adds some randomization to the process.  You will have to provide the binary both your group id and a password guess.   You may use any tools that you like and can reference any materials that would normally be available to you in the “real world”.  You MAY NOT communicate in any way with another group (except for your instructor) during the course of this final exam.

Groups should submit a report detailing their analysis of the binary, include the correct password.  Include in your report a summary of the contributions of each team member.
